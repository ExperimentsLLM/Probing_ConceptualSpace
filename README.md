# Probing_ConceptualSpace
The aim of this project is to explore the feasibility of similarly using LLMs for learning cognitively plausible representations of concepts, focusing in particular on the framework of conceptual spaces. We run the following three experiments and share our results:

Experiment1: In our first experiment, we analyse to what extent ChatGPT and GPT-4 can identify in which respect two concepts are similar. For instance, banana and lemon are similar in terms of colour, whereas lemon and lime are similar in terms of taste.

Experiment 2: In the second experiment, we analysed whether the model can identify concepts that are similar to a given one w.r.t. a given domain; e.g. name three fruits which are similar in colour to a lemon. 

Experiment 3: The third experiment focuses on quality dimensions. Specifically, we analyse to what extent ChatGPT and GPT-4 are able to rank a set of concepts along dimensions such as size or price.
